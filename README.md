The system is divided into two parts: 1. BS system, the entry and query of each transaction, the real-time trend of each foreign exchange, various charts of historical trend, intelligent analysis, crawler, external interface, etc. are all in this system; 2. Android reminder and windows reminder are mainly used to check the trend and market reminder. Technical description: BS system: layui, JS, jQuery, css+css3, H5, mysql, SSM (spring, springmvc, mybatis), springboot, redis, etc., developed using idea; Android reminder: Android studio. This system was developed by me around 2020. At present, some data may not be available, and the relevant logo changes should be available. Now the source code is made public. Because there is no time for the moment, it is made public directly without code adjustment and optimization. I hope it will be helpful to the spread of technology. The disclosure of this code is purely technical exchange, and no fee is charged.
